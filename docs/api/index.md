- [Synchronous API](synchronous.md) - Synchronous API that uses blocking database connectors
- [Reactor API](reactor.md) - Reactive API that uses [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) and reactive database connectors
- [RxJava API](rxjava.md) - Reactive API that uses [RxJava (v2)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and reactive database connectors
